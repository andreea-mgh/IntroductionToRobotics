# Homework 8

This next assignment is about the implementation of the game menu using a 16x2 LCD. I made a greeting message and added a configuration menu that saves the LCD and Matrix brightness settings into the EEPROM. The game logic is still a work in progress but the basic functionality is there.

## Components
* 1x 8x8 LED matrix
* 1x MAX7219 IC
* 1x joystick module
* 1x 16x2 LCD screen
* 1x buzzer
* 1x 10K resistor
* 1x 330Ω resistor
* 1x 10μF capacitor
* 1x 0.1μF capacitor
