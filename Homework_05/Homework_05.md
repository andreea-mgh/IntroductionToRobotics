# Homework 5

The task was to implement a stopwatch that counts in tenths of a second with 3 buttons: Start/Pause, Reset and Lap.

* The stopwatch is by default in *pause* mode with the time set at 0.
* The Start/Pause button toggles the *pause* mode.
* The Reset button resets the timer only in *pause* mode.
* While the stopwatch is running, pressing the Lap button saves the timestamp.
* After the timer is reset it can enter *lap viewer* mode by pressing the Lap button.
* The Lap button also cycles through the timestamps while in *lap viewer* mode.

## Components

* 1x 74HC595 IC
* 1x 4-digit 7-segment display
* 8x 330Î© resistor
* 4x pushbutton

## Notes
* To prevent flickering, whenever certain actions are triggered (save lap, reset lap) they will wait one cycle to be executed. This is to make sure there is no noticeable delay in the display writing.
