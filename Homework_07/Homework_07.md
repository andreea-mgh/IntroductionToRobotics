# Homework 7

As a preparation for the matrix game project, I made a small version of the Bomberman game, with no enemies. For this assignment I also used classes, one for the player and one for the bombs. The walls are randomly generated and there's a gap for the player and the exit, as well as some extra walls around them.

You spawn in the top left corner of the map. You lose if you get blown up by your bombs. You win if you get to the bottom right corner. Losing and winning will play an animation and will restart the game.
